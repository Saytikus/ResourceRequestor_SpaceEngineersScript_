# SmartTransferer
SmartTransferer is a dual script for space engineers. It contains a single version for transferring elements from one container to one. And it contains a multiple version to transfer items from one repository to another. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script is not yet fully implemented, so there is no manual for working with it. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment, a single version is implemented (SmartTransfererSingle), but ONLY for transmission of components .
